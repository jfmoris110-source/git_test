  <details><summary>laws of power</summary>
   <pre> 
Some key principles you’ll learn: Use your enemies, keep others dependent on you,
say as little as possible, take credit for others’ work, control all the options,
don’t take sides, create a cult following, and don’t get your hands dirty.

You can choose to apply or dismiss these rules – but you can’t escape them.

The 48 Laws of Power
What are the 48 Laws of Power? Here are all 48 laws, with explanations:


Law 1: Never Outshine the Master: Ensure that those above you always feel superior.
Go out of your way to make your bosses look better and feel smarter than anyone else.
Everyone is insecure, but an insecure boss can retaliate more strongly than others
can.

Law 2: Never Put too Much Trust in Friends, Learn How to Use Enemies: Keep a close
eye on your friends — they get envious and will undermine you. If you co-opt an enemy,
he’ll be more loyal than a friend because he’ll try harder to prove himself worthy
of your trust.

Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions: Always hide your true intentions. Create a smokescreen.
If you keep people off-balance and in the dark, they can’t counter your efforts.

Law 4: Always Say Less than Necessary: Say little and be ambiguous, leaving the meaning
to others to interpret. The less you say, the more intimidating and powerful you
are.

Law 5: So Much Depends on Reputation — Guard It with Your Life: Nurture and guard
your reputation because reputation is integral to power. With a strong reputation,
you can influence and intimidate others.

Law 6: Create an Air of Mystery: Be outrageous or create an aura of mystery. Any
attention — positive or negative — is better than being ignored. Attention brings
you wealth.

Law 7: Get Others to Do the Work for You, but Always Take the Credit: Get others
to do your work for you. Use their skill, time, and energy to further your ambitions
while taking full credit. You’ll be admired for your efficiency.

Law 8: Make Other People Come to You — Use Bait if Necessary: Make your opponent
come to you. When you force others to act, you’re in control. Bait them, then attack.

Law 9: Win Through Your Actions, Never Through Argument: Demonstrate your point rather
than arguing. Arguing rarely changes anyone’s mind, but people believe what they
see. They’re also less likely to be offended.

Law 10: Infection: Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky: Avoid miserable people. The perpetually
miserable spread misery like an infection, and they’ll drown you in it.

Law 11: Learn to Keep People Dependent on You: Make your superior dependent on you.
The more she needs you, the more security and freedom you have to pursue your goals.

Law 12: Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm Your Victim: Use honesty and
generosity to disarm and distract others from your schemes. Even the most suspicious
people respond to acts of kindness, leaving them vulnerable to manipulation.

Law 13: When Asking for Help, Appeal to People’s Self-Interest, Never to their Mercy
or Gratitude: When you need help from someone in a position of power, appeal to their
self-interest. They’ll be glad to help if they’ll get something in return, and you’ll
get what you want without seeming desperate or irritating.

Law 14: Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy: Be friendly, sympathetic, and interested
to get people to reveal their deepest thoughts and feelings. When you know your opponent’s
secrets, you can predict his behavior and control him.

Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally: Crush your enemy completely. If you leave even
one ember smoldering, it will eventually ignite. You can’t afford to be lenient.

Law 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor: Once you’ve become well-known,
don’t wear out your welcome. The more you’re seen and heard from, the more you cheapen
your brand. 

Law 17: Keep Others in Suspended Terror: Cultivate an Air of Unpredictability: Throw
others off balance and unnerve them with random, unpredictable acts. You’ll gain
the upper hand.

Law 18: Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself – Isolation is Dangerous: Never
isolate yourself when under pressure. This cuts you off from information you need,
and when real danger arises you won’t see it coming. 

Law: 19: Know Who You’re Dealing With – Do Not Offend the Wrong Person: When attempting
to deceive someone, know who you’re dealing with, so you don’t waste your time or
stir up a hornets’ nest in reaction.

Law 20: Do Not Commit to Anyone: Don’t commit to any side or cause except yourself.
By maintaining your independence, you remain in control — others will vie for your
attention. You also have the ability to pit the sides against each other.

Law 21: Play a Sucker to Catch a Sucker – Seem Dumber Than Your Mark: Make your intended
victims feel as though they’re smarter than you are, and they won’t suspect you of
having ulterior motives.

Law 22: Use the Surrender Tactic: Transform Weakness into Power: When you’re weaker,
surrender rather than fighting for the sake of honor. This gives you time to build
strength and undermine your victor. You’ll win in the end.

Law 23: Concentrate Your Forces: Focus your resources and energies where you’ll have
the most impact or get the most benefit. Otherwise, you’ll waste limited time and
energy.

Law 24: Play the Perfect Courtier: Learn the rules of the society you’re playing
in, and follow them to avoid attracting unfavorable attention. This includes appearing
like a team player and being careful about criticizing diplomatically.

Law 25: Re-Create Yourself: Create a powerful image that stands out, rather than
letting others define you. Change your appearance and emotions to suit the occasion.
People who seem larger than life attract admiration and power.

Law: 26: Keep Your Hands Clean: You’ll inevitably make mistakes or need to take care
of unpleasant problems. But keep your hands clean by finding others to do the dirty
work, and scapegoats to blame.

Law 27: Play on People’s Need to Believe to Create a Cultlike Following: Offer people
something to believe in and someone to follow. Promise the world but keep it vague;
whip up enthusiasm. People will respond to a desperate need for belonging. Followers
line your pockets, and your opponents are afraid to rile them.

Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness: When you act, do so boldly — and if you make
mistakes, correct them with even greater boldness. Boldness brings admiration and
power.

Law 29: Plan All the Way to the End: Make detailed plans with a clear ending. Take
into account all possible developments. Then don’t be tempted from your path. Otherwise,
you risk being surprised and forced to react without time to think.

Law 30: Make Your Accomplishments Seem Effortless: Make difficult feats seem effortless
and you’ll inspire awe in others and seem powerful. By contrast, when you make too
much of your efforts, your achievement will seem less impressive and you’ll lose
respect.

Law 31: Control the Options: Get Others to Play with the Cards You Deal: To deceive
people, seem to give them a meaningful choice. But sharply limit their options to
a few that work in your favor regardless of which they choose. Your victims will
feel in control, but you’ll pull the strings. 

Law 32: Play to People’s Fantasies: Conjure up alluring fantasies in contrast to
the gloomy realities of life, and people will flock to you. Spin the right tale and
wealth and power will follow.

Law 33: Discover Each Man’s Thumbscrew: Everyone has a weakness, a hole in his armor.
Find it and it’s leverage that you can use to your advantage. 

Law 34: Be Royal in Your Own Fashion: Act Like a King to Be Treated Like One: Act
like royalty and people will treat you that way. Project dignity and supreme confidence
that you’re destined for great things, and others will believe it.

Law 35: Master the Art of Timing: Anticipate the ebb and flow of power. Recognize
when the time is right, and align yourself with the right side. Be patient and wait
for your moment. Bad timing ends careers and ambitions.

Law 36: Disdain Things You Cannot Have: Ignoring Them Is the Best Revenge: Sometimes
it’s better to ignore things because reacting can make small problems worse, make
you look bad, and give your enemy attention.

Law 37: Create Compelling Spectacles: In addition to words, use visuals and symbols
to underscore your power. What people see makes a greater impression on them than
what they hear. 

Law 38: Think as You Like But Behave Like Others: Don’t make a show of being different,
or people will think you look down on them and will retaliate against you.

Law 39: Stir Up Waters to Catch Fish: Always stay calm and objective. When you get
angry, you’ve lost control. But if you can make your enemies angry, you gain an advantage.


Law 40: Despise the Free Lunch: Use money and generosity strategically to achieve
your goals. Use gifts to build a reputation of generosity, and also to obligate people
to you.

Law 41: Avoid Stepping Into a Great Man’s Shoes: If you succeed a great leader or
famous parent, find or create your own space to fill. Sharply separate from the past
and set your own standards — or you’ll be deemed a failure for not being a clone
of your predecessor.

Law 42: Strike the Shepherd and the Sheep Will Scatter: Trouble in a group often
starts with a single individual who stirs the pot. Stop them before others succumb
to their influence.

Law 43: Work on the Hearts and Minds of Others: Win others’ hearts and minds. Play
on their emotions and weaknesses, and appeal to their self-interest. You’ll have
them eating out of your hand, and they’ll be less likely to turn on you.

Law 44: Disarm and Infuriate with the Mirror Effect: Seduce people by mirroring their
emotions and interests; create the illusion that you share their values. They’ll
be so grateful to be understood that they won’t notice your ulterior motives. 

Law 45: Preach the Need for Change, But Never Reform Too Much at Once: Talk change
but move slowly. Evoke revered history and cloak your changes in familiar rituals.
Too much change is unsettling and will spark backlash.

Law 46: Never Appear Too Perfect: To forestall or mitigate envy, admit to a flaw
or weakness, emphasize the role of luck, or downplay your talents. If you don’t recognize
and nip envy in the bud, it will grow and the envious will work insidiously against
you. 

Law 47: Do Not Go Past the Mark You Aimed For; In Victory, Learn When to Stop: When
you’ve won, don’t let emotions push you past your goal. The moment of victory is
dangerous because if you press your luck, you’ll blunder into something you haven’t
planned for. 

Law 48: Assume Formlessness: Be flexible, fluid, and unpredictable — formless — so
your opponents can’t get a fix on you and can’t figure out how to respond.
