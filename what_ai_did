Short summary — what_ai_did

Date: 2025-11-02

I created a detailed HTML record at `what_ai_did.html` that documents all changes made to add a Yarn + Biome workflow, Husky hooks, and granular lint-staged rules. See `what_ai_did.html` for the full log.

Key edits (short):
- Updated `package.json` scripts and added devDependencies for `husky`, `lint-staged`, `stylelint`, and `htmlhint`.
- Added `.husky/pre-commit` and updated it to be Husky v10-compatible.
- Made lint-staged rules per-file-type (JS/TS/JSON/MD -> Biome, CSS -> stylelint, HTML -> htmlhint).
- Merged the temporary `WORKFLOW.md` content into `README.md` under "Developer workflow".

Run these to finish locally:
  yarn install
  yarn prepare
  git add README.md package.json .husky what_ai_did what_ai_did.html
  git commit -m "Add yarn/biome workflow, husky hooks, and lint-staged rules"

End of summary.
